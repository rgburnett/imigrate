    IEXPORT(1DB)		DBDESIGN COMMANDS		IEXPORT(1DB)



  
   Name 	: iexport - capture a database snapshot for data migration 
  
   Synopsis	: iexport database
  
   Arguments	: database 	- name of a database
  
   Description	: iexport exports the contents of all tables within a database
  		  to a series of compressed output files and a copy of the 
  		  database schema withing a directory called 
  		  <databasename>.cexp.
  
   Options	: none 
  
   Notes	: The name of the export directory is suffixed by .cexp to signify
  		  a compressed export.
  
  		  The standard informix utility dbexport provides the same 
  		  functionality with one large caveat: it cannot handle tables
  		  where the size exceeds the current hard ulimit. As we are 
  		  regularily dealing with volumes far in excess of this, the 
  		  need for this tool becomes apparent.
  
  		  All exported files are held as compress(1) files and, if need
  		  be, can be uncompress(1)ed.
  
   Status	: SUPPORTED
