   Name 	: imkppfile - build template iimport preprocess file
  
   Usage	: imkppfile <source database> <target database>
  
   Arguements	: <source database> - where the data currently resides. 
  
  		  <target database> - Destination database for source data
  
   Description	: imkppfile builds a template preprocess file for the iimport(1DB)
  		  tool. The template allows you to customise a script which will
  		  be used by iimport to transfer data from the migration database
  		  to the target database.
  
  		  By default, all tables in the target database are assumed to
  		  be in the source database. An insert/select statement is 
  		  built for each statement:
  
  		    INSERT INTO
  			dbtarget:customer
  		    (
  			customer_num,
  			lname,
  			fname,
  			company,
  			address1,
  			address2,
  			city,
  			state,
  			zipcode,
  			phone
  		    )
  		    SELECT
  			customer_num,
  			lname,
  			fname,
  			company,
  			address1,
  			address2,
  			city,
  			state,
  			zipcode,
  			phone
  		    FROM
  			dbsource:customer;
  
  		  It is then up to the end user to customise these statements
  		  to perform the necessary translations.
