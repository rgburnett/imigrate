   Name 	: iimport - migrate a database to the current in-situ schema
  
   Synopsis	: iimport database [ -p preprocess file ]
  			[ -d directory for migration space ]
  		        [ -o percentage occupancy of free disk space ]
  
   Arguments	: database	is a database to migrate to
  
  		  -d directory	a directory in which to create the migrate space.
  
  		  -p filename 	A Pre process SQL file
  
  		  -o NNN	a percentage of free disk space which iimport 
  		                will occupy. There is a default of 90%.
   
   Description	: iimport performs a migration of data from a compressed 
  		  export of a database or series of databases produced 
  		  by the tool iexport(1DB).
  
  		  A new database space is created called migratedbs.
  		  A database called migratedb is created and the 
  		  source tables are created and loaded.
  		  
  		  The disk space for this new dbspace is culled from
  		  the directory specified with the -d <dirname> flag.
  		  If this is not supplied, the environment variable
  		  MIGRATEDBSDIR is queried. If this is not set, 
  		  the default of /export/database (which is guaranteed 
  		  to be 1.2 *
  		  the size of the target database) is used..
  
  		  The optional user supplied preprocess script against 
  		  the source tables performing any data/column 
  		  manipulations.
  
  		  Constraints on the target database are disabled 
  		  (constraints/indexes/triggers N.B. CHECK 
  		  constraints are NOT disabled)
  
  	          Violation and diagnostic tables started on the target
  		  tables. 
  
  		  Any data in the target database is deleted prior to the 
  		  data in the source tables being transferred.
  		  
  		  Constraints are now enabled and any violations reported 
  		  to the user, who then has the responsibility of massaging
  		  the non-conformant data into the target database.
  		  
  		  This process is repeatable in the event of data errors.
  
   preprocess.sql
   Script File	
  		: This file can contain any legitimate SQL statements, 
  		  including multi-table selects/inserts.
  
   Caveats	: Due to time constraints, blob/text data are not catered
  		  for in either iexport or iimport. It would require 
  		  approximately two/three man days to add this.
   
   Algorithm	: This is how iimport works and the various steps
  		  that are performed internally.
  
  		  parse program arguments (iimport.ParseArgs)
  
  		  create a new dbspace called migratedbs. This creates
  		  all chunks as necessary.
  
  		  create source database in migratedbs 
  
  		  Parse a list of DDL statements from the 
  		  file <dbname>.cexp/<dbname>.sql file	
  				(iimport.MigrateDatabase.CreateTableDDL)
  
  		  for each source table
  		  do
  		      Create table in migratedb
  
  		      Load data into source table from compressed file series
  
                  done			  
  
  		  run preprocess.sql file
  
  		  for each target table
  		  do
   		      Create all violations tables on the target tables	
  
  		      Delete existing data from the target tables
  
  	  	      insert data from source table into target table.		
  
  		  done
  
  		  for each target table
  		  do
  		      Turn on RI and report errors 
  		  done
  
  		  Drop database migratedb 
  
  		  Drop database space migratedbs
