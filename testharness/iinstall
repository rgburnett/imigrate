dbimport dbsource

dbimport dbtarget

cat <<!

Now you can test iexport on the database dbsource. When this is complete
and you are happy with the results, you will have to rename the dbsource.cexp
directory to dbtarget.cexp and the file dbsource.cexp/dbsource.sql to 
dbtarget.cexp/dbtarget.sql. You can then run iimport.
